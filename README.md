# Etch-a-Sketch

This project will be one of my earlier projects that works to combine my beginner knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS
in creating an "etch-a-sketch" using grid blocks that span the webpage. The key aspects here will be getting the grid
squares to stay together with no space, and creating hovering effects when the mouse is moved over the grid blocks.

I will also add a button that will prompt the user to put in the number of squares they want for a new grid (with
the maximum being 100). Submitting their number should create a new grid that replaces the old one
